<h3 align="center">My friend Dan cures home-made salami.</h3>

</br></br>
Dan wants to manage a Raspberry Pi which controls his fridge's thermostat and humidifier
- I'm using [Next.js 13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) for the front & back ends

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) will CRUD Dan's recipes

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) will connect Dan to his Raspberry Pi.

- The RP will control the fridge via some [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts

Let's go :)
